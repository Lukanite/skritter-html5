# Skritter HTML5

Skritter HTML5 is a partial port and adaptation of the Skritter application primary written in JavaScript. It aims to match the functionality of the current Flash and iOS versions. The code tries to maintain flexibility in the sense it can be deployed as a browser or store application without needing to alter the codebase.

## Building

The repository is structured like a standard Cordova project. The www directory can be copied directly to web server to test the web-application and can be built using the Cordova command line to test the Android flavor. I have excluded the media files (audio and strokes) from the repository as they are rather bulky. They can be downloaded and copied into the proper folder using the link provided below.

##Requirements##
- Cordova 3.0+
- Media folder
- Node.js
